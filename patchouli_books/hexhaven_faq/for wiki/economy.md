This is a short guide to the economy here on Hexhaven.

Our society here does not have scarcity or needs, so the currency is just to enrich player interactions.

This money has no value if you do not use it for fun!

## Coins

Lunar, Solar, and Arcane coins are the server's official currency. One Arcane is 9 Solar, one Solar is 9 Lunar, and they can be combined up or down in a crafting menu to get change.

## Earning Lunar

Money exists on Hexhaven for a simple reason: *to have fun*.

Outside of shop ownership and your Universal Basic Income, there are many ways to earn and spend coins!

Here's just a few ways:
* Feed The Heart a golden apple when her lights have gone down
* Facilitate one-on-one trades with other players
* Exchange coins for services like fetch quests and manual labour

* Open a minigame and charge a small fee to play
* Lean into the roleplay aspect and open a donation charity or subscription service
* Start a cult and require a tithe

## Hexhaven Heart

This is the central force of our economy, a large rainbow tree standing right at spawn.

Thanks to the blessings of this tree, each player receives 5 Lunar per daily login!

This is your Universal Basic Income, and your primary method of earning coins besides player transactions. Though there is one other way...

## Lights

While we rely on The Heart, The Heart also relies on us!

There are 9 lights below the roots of the tree showing her life force. Every hour, if at least one player is logged in, a light ticks off.

Feeding a single golden apple onto the target block will completely revive The Heart, causing her to gift you coins proportional to the number of lights restored.

## Blooming Weekend

Every so often, The Heart goes into bloom! During these weekends, the daily login bonus is upped to 1 Solar, and the lights tick down every half hour instead of every hour.

This means more coins for everyone, but beware!

It also means the tree's life force drains faster. You don't want to let those lights completely fade...

## Heart Death

When the last light fades, The Heart will call out for help in the server chat! Rush to her aid, or it may be too late.

When The Heart dies, she dies... and with her, the daily login coins cease as well.

Life is full of release and renewal, and The Heart has died before!

## Heart Revive

When The Heart dies, our community comes together to bring her back.

This comes in the form of a Fundraiser Event! You will have 2 weeks to raise the necessary materials (chosen semi-randomly at the time of the event) to revive The Heart.

We often offer a 'stretch goal' which, if reached, will upgrade The Heart's capabilities in some way- either increasing her output or providing better safeguards against future demise.
