## Introduction

**Blessbane** at its core is a community focused, spooky event and event space that furthers the greater Hexhaven lore. Players can participate at any time! All previous events, minigames, and puzzles remain functional for players to enjoy.

## Blessbane

While the name **Blessbane** encompasses the entire space through the portal, **Blessbane** really is the initial village area, from the [first ever Blessbane event](#blessbane-2023). This space was created by the **Server** after [The Researcher](#the-researcher) broke in, in an attempt to find the truth behind the death of The Heart of Hexhaven.

## Blessbane 2023

In the year 2023, Hexhaven experienced a lull in membership. [The Heart of Hexhaven](https://github.com/katubug/Hexhaven/wiki/Economy#hexhaven-heart) died due to this neglect, and she remained dormant for months.

After the extended period of dormancy, people joining and rejoining the server began to question the purpose of The Heart. Thus, [Blessbane](#blessbane) was born-- an in-world representation of the toll that prolonged death had on The Heart and the server as a whole.

This initial season was focused on the revival of the true Heart of Hexhaven, requiring Golden Apples to complete. This marked the first [Revival Event](https://github.com/katubug/Hexhaven/wiki/Economy#heart-revive), requiring 100,000 Golden Apples to complete and push back the creeping influence of **Blessbane**.

The initial concept of **Blessbane** was a parasitic alternate universe that sought to pry its roots into the Hexhaven community and siphon away all magic and life in the world.

Within this season, [Minigames](#minigames) were provided for easy and fun prizes of tickets which could then be exchanged into Golden Apples and other prizes.

In addition to Minigames, other sources of Golden Apples were scattered loot chests, but players soon discovered something else among the apples... a series of journals left by an individual known as [The Researcher](#the-researcher). This Hexhaven resident dedicated his research and time to discovering the origin of Hexhaven's sickness and initially opened the portal to **Blessbane**.

During the season, The Heart of Hexhaven appeared dead and lifeless, while [The Root](#root) **Blessbane's** tree, was lush and teeming with life, magical archwood energy coursing through its trunk.

The finale of the event caused a permenant severence between The Heart and The Root, with **Blessbane** no longer having a source of energy from Hexhaven. The husk of The Root remains among the empty streets of **Blessbane**.

## Blessbane 2024

Our beloved Mayor has gone missing! You must head into **Blessbane** and seek out [The Labyrinth](#the-labyrinth) where the mayor must be. Reports of distant croaking and faint ribbits were heard from [the center of the labyrinth](#center), one of the most dangerous places in **Blessbane**.

"text": "*Oh no! The mayor is missing! Are you able to find him?*

## The Labyrinth

The Labyrinth is a giant maze, with twistable walls, hidden pathways, a grove of warping trees, and secrets to find!

Your goal is to explore and hopefully reach [the center](#center) of the maze to rescue the mayor!

... and maybe some more secrets.

## The Researcher

Not much is known about this individual, just the 13 recorded journals left behind scattered throughout the **Blessbane** area. These books tell his story, the haunting tale of discovering and learning the truth about **Blessbane**.

"title": "The Hut",
"images": ["hexhaven:textures/faq/blessbane/researcher_hut.png"],
"text": "*What life did he live on Hexhaven? Where did he do his research? Who did he leave behind? And most importantly... where did he go?*

...these questions may be answered in a future chapter of **Blessbane**! For now, all we know was **Blessbane** affected him so greatly, it created a world so real that he felt like he never left his home of Hexhaven. Could these structures here be from §ohis§r memories...?

## The Root

This tall tree in the center of **Blessbane** may remind you slightly of the tree that inhabits Hexhaven. Despite its dendritic form, this is actually a taproot, **Blessbane’s** original and primary connection to Hexhaven. The Root has since been severed, leaving its decaying corpse standing here, but **Blessbane** has found new and inventive ways to sneak back into Hexhaven.

"title": "The Root",
"images": ["hexhaven:textures/faq/blessbane/root.png"],
"text": "*Seems to be a space to submit my tickets from [games...](#minigames)*

## Minigames

The main village area of **Blessbane** contains multiple Minigames which reward tickets in exchange for doing well in the games! These tickets can be exchanged for multiple random rewards. These can be Golden Apples, Golden Apple Crates, Witch Cat Plushies, and a selection of custom hats (by Astrofush)!

See the following pages for the list of minigames!

"text": "The Feral Beasts seek to end your life... how long can you last? Dodge blades, the beasts, and scoop up tickets along the way! My record is a stack :)

"text": "Lift your crossbow and blast them from the sky! Chicken Knockout tests your skill with multishot to get as many tickets as you can with limited arrows!

...and more to come!"

## Echofolk

Some memories are lost, allowed to freely roam the center of the Labyrinth. Each has a story to tell, from the fragments of data it came from.

Some travelled the Outerlands too fast, some sought to stay past the reset time, some loaded chunks while there were too many people online. All the lost information trickles down here, as Echofolk.

*Maybe using a book on these Echofolk might imprint their story...*

## Center

Something old, something... §lnew.§r

A copy of Hexhaven's spawn, shaped and molded by Blessbane in its own image. What was beautiful prose is now twisted, malformed snippets of half-thoughts-- what once was lush greenery is now dull, and petrified.

The mayor is close. Follow his frog-prints, there might be a clue!
