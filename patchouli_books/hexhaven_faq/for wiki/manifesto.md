# Cozy Coven Manifesto

Hexhaven is a cozy, supportive community.

This is more than a minecraft SMP- it's a safe space for people to escape real world troubles.

We strive to be better by looking out for one another and our server.

## Admin Team

Your admin team believes that safe spaces should be managed with kindness, patience, and transparency.

We do not adhere to 'punishment' tactics such as mutes, temporary bans, or public shaming.

We prefer to resolve issues through communication first and foremost.

However, this does not mean that we allow ourselves to be walked over! Members who break the Dingus rule, or require repeated warnings for similar actions, will find themselves removed from our space.

We care about protecting and maintaining the trust within our community.

## Communication

Tied in with consent, communication is vital.

Our community has a wide diversity of countries, ages, and neurodiversities.

Many of us have different perspectives and experiences, and misunderstandings do happen!

We encourage players to communicate directly with one another, to ask for accommodations or clarifications when needed, and to try to assume positive intent from others.

Just as you hope that others will not misinterpret you - try to reflect that in your own responses.

## Consent

Consent is not just sexy- it's cool!

We do not have explicit rules against jokes, pranks, teasing, or mock rivalries... but these are all things that require consent from both parties in order to be considered Fun and not Dingus Behaviour.

The same is true for topics brought up in the global chats.

It's best to not assume something is okay with everyone, and just ask instead!

## Honesty

Honesty is the best policy, as they say. Honesty will serve you well here. Hexhaven has built a strong base of trust within her community and her admin team, and this is maintained by being genuine with one another.
