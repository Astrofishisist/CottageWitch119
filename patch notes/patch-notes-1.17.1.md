# **Config and Script Changes**
This update begins the process of replacing Refined Storage with Applied Energistics 2. This was a decision made in light of some bizarre performance issues, and was highly requested. We have made similar thematic changes to AE2 as was made to RS, and we have also balanced it to be appropriate to a non-techy-grindy pack. In the 1.18 update of Cottage Witch, Refined Storage will be removed. The update notes will warn you to backup your worlds and ensure that no data loss occurs, but if you like to prepare early - this is your long-term advance warning.


- Set FOV effects to 100% to prevent players feeling like the sprint button was broken.
- Turned on view bobbing.
- Began process of phasing out Refined Storage.
- Unbound the shift+b hotkey for the Backpacked backpacks.
- Removed the "Chests Reimagined" resource pack, as it was causing issues with horses and ender chests.
- Saved all keybinds and settings to DefaultSettings - hopefully it works!
- Changed JEI quest in the welcome page to be larger and more centered for ease of access.
- Updated item tooltips to be warning colored.
- Added arzadu's Hexerei woodcutting recipes. Thanks, arz!
- Updated Earl's Extra Delights Create integration to patch an extra bowl out of crafting.
- Tagged gate pearls and hemolymph blasters so they can no longer be uncrafted.
- Removed Refurbished mail items from jei and recipes, as they're not needed.
- Removed Haggis!!!
- The welcome quest now gives a backpack instead of a sack.
- Fixed an issue where dead coral could be magically resurrected through smelting.
- Removed numerical mana charm, as that setting is on by default.
- Added a script to blacklist cages from being used inappropriately.
- Due to lag issues, Pathfinder Maps are now disabled.
- Entity Culling can now work on Soul Beads and Create's Trains.
- Inventory-capable mounts can now be sorted with Sortingwood!
- Fixed an issue where FTB Maps accidentally re-enabled themselves. Thanks, Turtles!
- Added a few missing Stonecutter recipes for Smooth Sourcestone. Thanks, arz!
- Peat and Lush Dirt are now craftable. Thanks, arz!
- A WHOLE LOT of Hexerei woodcutting recipes have been added. Thanks, arz!

## ImmediatelyFast
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast)

### ImmediatelyFast 1.4.0
*   This is the last release for Minecraft 1.19-1.19.2. Minecraft 1.19-1.19.2 support is now discontinued
*   Made horse armor layering fix compatible with modded horse armor
*   Changed the versioning of ImmediatelyFast. The minor version is now incremented with every Minecraft update. The patch version is incremented with every ImmediatelyFast release. This aims to group all releases for a specific Minecraft version together. It also allows for more frequent releases because I can do a release for a single Minecraft version instead having to accumulate enough changes to justify a release for all supported versions.

### ImmediatelyFast 1.3.6
*   Avoid brittle injections (Might reduce crashes caused by mod incompatibilities)

### ImmediatelyFast 1.3.5
*   (1.21.2+) Fixed AppleSkin graphical issue (The exhaustion bar is now correctly displayed)
*   (1.21.4) Fixed crash when enabling the sign buffering optimization on NeoForge
*   (1.21.4) Readded (Lex)Forge support
*   Improved thread stacktrace logging (It now uses the correct logger)

### ImmediatelyFast 1.3.4
*   Improved core shader modification detection (Fixes graphical issues on some servers with resource packs)
*   Documented the config options. You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast?tab=readme-ov-file#config).
*   (1.20) Fixed graphical issues with Draconic Evolution, Multiblocked2 and Scorched Guns 2 by disabling HUD batching when they are loaded.
*   (1.21+) Fixed buffer corruption issues if the buffer is used over multiple frames (Fixes graphical issues with Paladins & Priests)
*   Added VulkanMod to the list of incompatible mods (It didn't work with ImmediatelyFast before anyway)

### ImmediatelyFast 1.3.3
*   Added support for 1.21.4 (Fabric and NeoForge)
*   (Forge) Mark mod as clientside only (Only visual change)

### ImmediatelyFast 1.3.2
*   Enforce text layer draw order (Fixes layering issues with custom fonts in server resource packs)
*   1.21.2+ only: Readded Forge support
*   1.21.2+ only: Fixed compatibility with NeoForge 21.3.23+

### ImmediatelyFast 1.3.1
*   Reverted fast buffer upload to old approach
    *   The previous method (Using a streaming buffer) didn't show much of an extra performance improvement, but was a lot more complex/error-prone and doesn't work on older GPUs.
    *   If you notice a significant performance drop or graphical glitches when updating to this version, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
*   1.21.2+ only: Fixed performance regression on Apple GPUs
*   1.21.2+ only: Screen Batching: Only batch container items and chat screen
*   1.21.2+ only: Added workaround for item cooldown render order issue

### NEBs Release 2.0.3 for 1.19 - 1.19.2
NEBs 2.0.3
==========

*   Refactored a lot of backend code (sorry if any devs were using this, but I don't think that's the case)
    *   This was mostly done to prepare for multiloader sometime later. The class that handles the item model overrides is now completely mod loader agnostic.
    *   Translated mixins to coremods. See the README on the GitHub page for why I did this.
*   Fixed 1.16.1 - 1.19.2 just straight up not working
*   Added support for 1.13.2, 1.14.4, and 1.15.x
*   Added support for 1.21.3 and 1.21.4
*   Performance improvements for 1.18 and older when baking models (on startup and F3 + T)
*   The source jars for 1.13.2 - 1.16.5 are now in SRG names (useful for devs, use fg.deobf)

NEBs 2.0.2
==========

*   Fixed F3 + T causing models to fail to load (for real this time)
*   Fixed Spread of Ailments texture not using transparent background ([#63](https://github.com/infernalstudios/Nekos-Enchanted-Books/pull/63))
*   Fixed some Apotheosis enchantment books not showing their textures
*   Fixed NEBs not correctly logging enchantments that do not have a model
    *   Enchantments that do not have a model are now logged in alphabetical order in a single log message
*   Fixed Lightweight from Feathers not showing its texture
*   Added support for Forge 1.21
    *   Fabric and NeoForge support will come at a later date

NEBs 2.0
========

Neko's Enchanted Books got a huge overhaul in its 2.0 update with its main new feature: automatic model loading.

### NEBs Release 2.0.1 for 1.19 - 1.19.2
NEBs 2.0.1 is a small patch that fixes a potential model loading issue caused by modded enchantments when resources are loaded after startup (i.e. F3 + T).

NEBs 2.0
========

Neko's Enchanted Books got a huge overhaul in its 2.0 update with its main new feature: automatic model loading. In short, this gives users the power to add compatibility for whatever enchantments they'd like without NEBs itself needing to add native support for it! Check out the main CurseForge page or the GitHub repository for more details on how you can use this towards your advantage!

Technical Changelog
-------------------

*   Added Automatic Model Loading
*   Now has wider range of supported versions

Native Compatibility Additions
------------------------------

These are all the new enchantments that NEBs 2.0 brings native compatibility for, along with all the enchantments from 1.8.

### [1.19.2 Forge] v 1.0.3
iChunUtil
=========

### 1.0.3

*   _Forge only:_ Register new key mappings in RegisterKeyMappingsEvent event.
*   _NeoForge only:_ Fixed registration of key mappings using the wrong event bus.
*   Changes to config handling due to the key mapping registrations above.

### 1.0.2

*   _Forge only:_ Fixed config crashes when NightConfigFixes is also installed.
*   _NeoForge only:_ Register new key mappings in RegisterKeyMappingsEvent event.
*   _NeoForge only:_ Added fake player detection with NeoForge's FakePlayer class.
*   Fixed crash when using navigation keys in B&S UIs.
*   Fixed text box selector in Config UI snapping to middle of text box when clicked.

### 1.0.1

*   _1.21 NeoForge only:_ Fixed load issue caused by config changes in NeoForge 21.0.82.
*   _1.20.4 NeoForge only:_ Fixed packet handler issue causing MC to freeze when loading.
*   Added file name as tooltip when mousing over the config types in the Config Editor GUI.

### 1.0.0

*   First release since rewrite.
    
*   Reset version number. We're starting from scratch (again), but now with NeoForge and Fabric!
    
    Non-iChunUtil dependent mods will now require iChunUtil for the variety of functions it provides, most notably Configs and Networking. iChunUtil will (possibly) gradually be rebuilt over time in the future for the rest of my projects.
    
    Major version will stay at 1, Minor version will increase as code-breaking changes are made, Build version will increase as non-breaking features are added or bugs are fixed. EG: 1.X.Y, X being Minor version, Y being Build version.

    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.
