# **Script and Config Changes**

- New egg drop soup - I mean, script. Using a Reaping Scythe on an creature now has a chance of dropping either a custom head or a spawn egg!
- Spawn eggs will no longer drop without a Scythe.
- Added several more mobs to be limited by inControl.

# **Changed Mods**
## ImmediatelyFast
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast)

### ImmediatelyFast 1.3.0
*   Added support for 1.21.2/1.21.3
*   Dropped support for 1.20.5/1.20.6
*   Fixed wolf collar rendering order
*   1.21.2+ only: Rewrote fast buffer upload to have less overhead in high (1000+) FPS scenarios
*   1.21.2+ only: Deprecated the ImmediatelyFast batching API. Mojang added basic batching into the DrawContext class. ImmediatelyFast now uses and extends this system, so the custom API is no longer needed. To migrate your mod, simply remove all calls to the ImmediatelyFast batching API and make sure to use the DrawContext for your HUD rendering.
*   1.21.2+ only: Made experimental universal HUD batching more efficient
