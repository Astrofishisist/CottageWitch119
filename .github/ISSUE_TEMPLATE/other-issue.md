**What Cottage Witch version are you using?**
Version: 

**How much RAM you have allocated (recommended 6-8gb)**
You can check this by viewing your launcher's settings. If you do not have 6gb allocated, please try this first.

**Clearly describe the issue**
Describe what is happening and what you are doing when and after it happens. For example, if your game goes "Not Responding" while loading (which is normal btw), are you clicking on the window? Are you letting it load? Do you have a lot of background processes? etc.

**Screenshots**
Attach relevant screenshots here.
